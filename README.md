php artisan serve
```
Visit ```http://localhost:8000``` in your browser.

## 🔐 Default Login
The application comes with a pre-configured **Super Admin** account generated by the seeder. Since this is a premium setup, registration is disabled by default to ensure security.

Use these credentials to sign in:

| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Super Admin** | `architect@devscript.lab` | `password` |

> **Security Note:** After logging in for the first time, please navigate to **Settings** and update your profile information and password immediately.

### 🔄 Testing Password Reset Flow
To verify the secure recovery system (SMTP):
1. Navigate to the **Login Page**.
2. Click on the **"Forgot Password?"** link.
3. Enter the admin email: `architect@devscript.lab`.
4. Check your **Mailtrap** inbox (or configured SMTP) to view the secure reset link.

## 📧 Email Configuration (SMTP)
To use the "Send Invoice via Email" feature, configure your SMTP settings in .env. For local testing, we recommend using Mailtrap:
```bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@youragency.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```
